%% @doc the `end_key' for a bigset means we can calculate from the
%% tracker and sender_clock what dots have been removed by the sender
%% and must therefore be removed by the receiver. Returns the new
%% Tombstone and Clock. Events seen by the receiver and removed by the
%% sender will be added to the Tombstone. Events unseen by the
%% receiver but removed by the sender will be added to the clock (to
%% ensure they're never written.)

%%  @TODO NOTE: it is very possible that we add to the tombstone some
%%  event that has already been compacted out and therefore removed
%%  from the receivers tombstone. As yet we have no way of recording
%%  this efficiently, which means we may have a tombstone that
%%  accretes garbage over time. However, it depends on how compaction
%%  works, if compaction coves the _whole set_ then it can shrink the
%%  tombstone by simply subtracting the tombstone at the start of
%%  compaction from the one on disk at the end.
